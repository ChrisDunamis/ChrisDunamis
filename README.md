I spend my time unwinding, playing chess :chess_pawn:, keeping myself entertained watching the latest Hollywood blockbusters :movie_camera: :popcorn:, and YouTube gaming. But I love to write small programs :technologist: for small case scenarios to test my understanding of logic and algorithms, this is my way of passing time and my way of expression. I do equally enjoy outdoor activities, especially a variety of sports. I mostly enjoy :swimming_man: swimming, :tennis: tennis and :basketball_man: basketball, these are the few sports that help me focus and develop an inner self-ability, which contributes to my everyday life. I read a wide range of comic books, I am a huge Marvel and DC fan, with my favourite hero being Thor from Marvel and Hal Jordan‚Äôs Green Lantern from DC. I love both characters, as they are portrayed not just to being heroes, but disciplined, and lovers of knowledge, and family oriented, who wish to contribute positively to humanity, society and their multiverse earth; these are concepts to my beliefs, and the most important aspect to my own life and personal growth.
