<summary><u><em>Read more about me...</em></u></summary>
I spend my time unwinding, playing :chess_pawn: chess, :movie_camera: :popcorn: keeping myself entertained, watching the latest Hollywood blockbusters, and watching my favourite video games on YouTube Gaming. But I love to write small programs for small case scenarios to test my understanding of logic and algorithms, this is my way of passing time and my way of expression. I do equally enjoy outdoor activities, especially a variety of sports. I mostly enjoy swimming, tennis and basketball, these are the few sports that help me focus and develop an inner self-ability, which contributes to my everyday life. I read a wide range of comic books, I am a huge Marvel and DC fan, with my favourite hero being Thor from Marvel and Hal Jordan‚Äôs Green Lantern from DC. I love both characters, as they are portrayed not just to being heroes but disciplined, lovers of knowledge, and family-oriented, who wish to contribute positively to humanity, society and their multiverse earth; these are concepts to my beliefs, and the most important aspect to my own life and personal growth.
